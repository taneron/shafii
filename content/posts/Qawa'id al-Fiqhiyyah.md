Sheikh Sa'id al-Lahji begins his work _Idhah al-Qawa'id al-Fiqhiyyah_ with the famous verses of al-Sabban that contain the ten fundamentals which every student must know before delving into a particular subject:

_Indeed the fundamentals of every science are ten_:_The definition, the subject, and the fruits,__Its merit, relationship and founder,__The name, basis, and ruling of the lawgiver,__And the legal cases. Though some is sufficient__The one who obtains it all gains nobility_.
_     Qawa'id al-Fiqhiyyah_ deals with the principles through which the rulings of new occurrences are identified in the absence of a clear statement in the _Qur'an_, _Sunnah_, or _ijma_'. The subject matter of the science is the methodology of deducing fiqh rulings from the established legal maxims. The issues that one studies in the field constitutes the examination of the conditions and states of _furu'_, and determining the compatibility of the principles with the _furu_'.

_     Qawa'id al-Fiqhiyyah_ allows one to know the ruling of new occurrences when there is no clear _nass_from the lawgiver, and it allows one to understand a large amount of _furu'_ in a relatively short period of time. Being a branch of _fiqh_, the study of legal maxims naturally shares the merit that _fiqh_ enjoys: the best field after theology. 
      The field, sometimes referred to as _'ilm al-qawa'id al-fiqhiyyah_ or _ashbah wa al-nada'ir_, was founded by the masters of _furu'_, such as Abu Tahir and Qadi Husayn, who developed the field of study and transmitted the science to others. Later, Sultan al-'Ulama 'Izz Abd al-Salam came an authored an extensive work in the field. 
      The science is rooted in the _Qur'an_, _Sunnah_, and statements of the companions and mujtahid imams. It is communally obligatory to learn the science of _qawa'id al-fiqhiyyah_, and personally obligatory whenever a qadi appoints one to learn the science (6-7).
