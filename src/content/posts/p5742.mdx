#### 1a. Categories of water

There are basically three categories of water:

1. **Tahoor**: Water which is not only ritually pure but can also be used for ritual purification
2. **Taahir**: Water which is ritually pure but can not be used for ritual purification

- **Mutaghayyir**: Water which has changed so much that it would no longer be termed ‚_water_‚ alone without a necessary qualifier
- **Musta’mal**: Water which was used for ritual purification and thereby lost its capability to be used for another ritual purification

3. **Najis**: Water which is ritually impure

#### 1b. Amounts Of Water

There is another relevant aspect which relates to the water’s amount. There is

1. a _small_ and
2. _a large_

amount of water.

An amount of water which is less than roughly 216 liters is considered to be _small_ and an amount of water which is equal to or more than roughly 216 liters is considered to be a large amount of water. One wouldn’t have to be exact when it comes to this measure. It’s supposed to be approximated and not pinpointed. 216 liters is what is called ‚qullatayn‘.

When the terms _small_ and _large_ are used in relation to water then they should be understood accordingly.

#### 1c. Certainty And Doubt

There is a rule which is used in various topics of fiqh and is also very important in this topic: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Certainty is not lifted by doubt.</span>

This means that one wouldn’t leave that which one was certain for a subsequent uncertainty. And in case one doesn’t know anything about the object in question then one starts off with the initial assumption of that object, considering that to be „first certainty“. For example: The initial assumption in relation to meat is that is impure and prohibited to consume. This means that one would assume its prohibition until permissibility was established. For other things like water it is the other way around: The initial assumption is that water is tahoor.

With this important rule, which is a great blessing from ALLAH, muslims can safeguard themselves from many attacks of the shaytan. That’s why special attention will be paid to this aspect due to the widespread problems muslims have with these matters.

#### 1d. Other Categories Of Water

In the books of fiqh these two categories of water are also mentioned:

1. Pure and purifying water which would be disliked to be used on one’s body
2. Prohibited water

The former primarily relates to sun radiated water which is stored in metal containers in hot countries when used on one’s body. The reason for this is that such water was assumed to be harmful for the body. If its harmfulness was indeed likely then it would even be prohibited to use. Another example would be too hot or too cold water for wudu or ghusl because it might prevent one from being throrough in one’s washings.

The latter primarily relates to water which was used without right (e.g. stolen water).

These two categories were mentioned apart from the others because, theoretically speaking, they don’t really constitute distinct categories. In reality, they describe rulings that relate to external factors (i.e. prevention of harm, protection of property and the like).

2. Tahoor, pure and purifying

---

Water which is not only ritually pure but can also be used for ritual purification

#### 2a. Basics

Our scholars usually mention the following types of water:

1. Rain water
2. Sea water
3. River water
4. Well water
5. Spring water
6. Snow
7. Hail

One could summarize these in the following way: Water as it is normally found in nature  
\[Note: It is cruicial to read the third chapter (Mutaghayyir) as well to have a deeper and more reliable understanding of this statement.\]

#### 2b. Ritual Purification

Only tahoor water can be used to remove hadath and to get rid of the effects of ritual impurities on originally pure (solid, non-liquid) things. Water which is not tahoor would be useless for that (just like any other liquid) and would potentially even make things a lot worse when it comes to ritual impurities.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
  Being affected by a ritual impurity:
</span> When traces of a ritual impurity transfer on a ritually pure (solid, non-liquid)
object then it’s considered to be an object which was affected by a ritual impurity.
The object itself remains ritually pure.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lifting a state of hadath:</span> A person
who would like to pray needs to perform wudu. Thereby a state is lifted which would
prevent that person from performing a valid prayer. This state (or what led to that
state) is called minor hadath. The same also applies to ghusl and the so called major
(and moderate) hadath.

#### 2c. Tap Water

Tap water usually comes from a natural source and can, therefore, most of the time be used without any second thoughts. If tap water is gained by recycling dirty or impure water, which seems to done in some countries, then there are a few things to consider.

The way in which ritually impure water or significantly changed water would become normal tahoor water again will be explained in the respective chapters.

#### 2d. Matters Related To Certainty and Doubt

The initial assumption when it comes to water is that it is tahoor. This means that water is initially assumed to be tahoor up until one is certain that this is not the case anymore.

This means that one could generally assume tap water to be tahoor and fine, on condition one is not certain of the opposite.

3. Mutaghayyir, pure but not purifying

---

Water is not ritually purifying anymore as soon as it has changed due to a ritually pure substance so much that it would no longer be called ‚water‘ alone.

#### 3a. Basics

When the word _change_ is used then what is meant is a change in relation to the odor, color or taste of the water. In other words, any sensible/perceivable changes.

If one were to put a tea bag into a cup of tahoor water and, after a short amount of time, the water would change in a manner so that one would refer to liquid as something like _water with a slight tea taste_ then the water would still be deemed tahoor. Once the change becomes stronger up until one would refer to the liquid as _tea_ then it would no longer be tahoor. It would be just wrong to refer to it as just _water_ at that point*.*

If a change occurs at one part of the water but not another part of it then each part would be judged independetly. This means that one part of it having experienced a strong change would only change the ruling of that specific part and not the whole body of water. This applies to both a small and a large amount of water.

#### 3b. Unavoidable Changes

The scholars mention some types of changes in tahoor water which are too difficult to avoid. Water which is affected by those types of changes would therefore remain tahoor.

Examples:

- Water which is stored in a metal container for a long time and becomes brown or yellow due to the container’s rust
- Water which changes due to algae at the bottom of it or leaves from a tree that naturally drop into it
- Water which changes due to its proximity to oils or plants that have a strong odor
- Sea water, even if very salty
- Water which becomes muddy due to flowing over or sitting on earth

Causing these types of changes intentionally, for example by throwing leaves into the water, would not be something that is too difficult to avoid and would therefore not be excused (if they amount to such a significant change, of course). This means that such a water would no longer be tahoor, even if one wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between a significantly changed body of water in which (for example) leaves were thrown intentionally into and another significantly changed body of water in which leaves fell into naturally by themselves.  
But if one were to intentionally cause such a change in a body of tahoor water by adding another body of excused-changed water to it THEN it would not be treated like an intentional change but rather the mixture would remain to be excused and tahoor.

When it comes to earth that could be used for tayammum and sea salt, one could even intentionally throw them into tahoor water and the water would remain tahoor even if it changed significantly. Our scholars say that this is because sea salt originates in tahoor water and earth that can be used for tayammum is also tahoor. This means that one would just mix something that is tahoor with something else that is tahoor as well, which therefore shouldn’t harm it.

If fruits or flowers were to fall into tahoor water and were to change this water significantly then this would not be excused, though. The reason for this is that, although these things could also be attributed to nature, they don’t usually occur. So what matters is not just the difficulty of something but rather this difficulty also being common. Rare or non-common occurences, even if very difficult, would therefore not be excused.

#### 3c. Only Substances That Break Into And Mix With The Water

The only changes that matter are changes which are the result of a ritually pure substance breaking into and mixing with the water. Changes due to any other ritually pure substance would not be capable of making a water non-tahoor. This means that a change in tahoor water due to a piece of wood would be irrelevant, even if (although very unlikely) the tahoor water would change significantly through that. The same applies to substances like oil.

In order to change the water from a state of tahoor to taahir, the foreign substance would have to break into and mix with the tahoor water, being indistinguishable from the water. Substances like sugar would be an example for that.

#### 3d. Estimation Of Changes That Are Not Observable

If tahoor water were to mix with a ritually pure liquid that has qualities just like water (meaning, a liquid that couldn’t be told apart from water by its qualities) and could therefore never lead to any perceptible changes in the mixture then one would not be able to tell whether the water did change significantly or not. In this case one would do the following: One would assume this water-like foreign liquid to have moderate qualities and would then try to estimate whether the mixture would have such a significant change or not.

An example for liquids with moderate qualities would be pomegranate juice for the taste, incense for the odor and orange juice for the color.

This estimation is not obligatory but rather recommended. As long as one is not certain that the water would have changed based on such an estimation, one could just intentionally refrain from estimating it and still assume it to be tahoor. Estimating doesn’t mean that one would actually perform such an experiment with these substances. Just thinking it through would also count as a valid estimation.

#### 3e. Undoing Changes

If the change would disappear then the water would become tahoor again, once one would refer to it as just ‚water‘ again. This could be accomplished by filtering it or mixing it with other water; basically, whatever leads to the disappearance of this significant change. It would also suffice if the change disappears by itself over time.

#### 3f. Matters Related To Certainty And Doubt

If one is not certain whether tahoor water became taahir due to a change then one would assume it to remain tahoor. Examples:

- One is not certain whether the change was strong enough.
- When estimating the changes due to a water-like liquid (with or without an actual experiment), one is not certain whether a strong change would have occured.
- One is not certain whether a significant change was due to a substance which breaks into and mixes with the water or not.
- One is not certain whether a significant change was due to something that is excused due to it being difficult to avoid or due to something else.
- One is not certain whether a significant change was caused by sea salt or another type of salt.
- One is not certain whether a significant change was caused by earth that could be used for tayammum or earth that could not be used for tayammum.

The disappearance of strong changes within water (by, for example, adding water to it) would only suffice to make the water tahoor again if one became certain that the changes have sufficiently been reverted. If one is merely not sure that the changes remain strong enough then this would not suffice in this situation. The reason is that in this scenario the certainty would be the other way around: Water being mutaghayyir would be the certainty now and it would require another certainty to deem it tahoor again.

If one wanted to perform a recommended or obligatory wudu/ghusl and one had two buckets of water, one of which with tahoor water but the other one with tahir water, without knowing which bucket contains which water because the tahir water doesn’t show signs of its significant change (or isn’t even water but rather something like rose water), then one would perform wudu/ghusl which each of them. Thereby one definitely has performed the wudu/ghusl without any drawbacks.

\#Question: What if it is about the removal of ritual impurities? Then using both of them would probably not be the way to go, right?

4. Musta’mal, pure but not purifying

---

Water is no longer ritually purifying once it was used to remove the effects of ritual impurities or to lift a state of hadath.

#### 4a. Basics

Once tahoor water was used to remove the effects of ritual impurities or to lift a state of hadath it is no longer ritually purifying. It would then be called ritually used water.

#### 4b. Ritually Used

Water that was used to clean things, like, for examples, dishes or a car would obviously not become _used_ in this sense, though, as we are talking about **ritually** used water.

Ritual purification which does not cause a state of ritual purity would not lead to the water becoming ritually used. For example, performing the recommended ghusl for the friday prayer or performing other than the first washing of an obligatory wudu. In these scenarios no state of hadath would be lifted. The same applies to tahoor water that is being used to purify ritually pure dirt, like mucus.

\[For a recommended washing of wudu or ghusl to count, it has to be performed with tahoor water nevertheless.\]

#### 4c. At What Point It Becomes Used

The water would become ritually used at the moment it detaches from the area it is purifying. When it comes to lifting a state of hadath, this means, once the water detaches from the specific wudu area or, when it comes to ghusl, it detaches from the whole body. When it comes to removing the effects of ritual impurities then it means, once the water detaches from the whole area that was initially affected by the impurity.

The scholars mention that water which was used for an obligatory ghusl would not always become ritually used once it detaches from the body. They mention exceptions, like when water were to drip of one’s chin on one’s chest. These types of natural and common things are therefore of no consequence because that would entail hardship.

**More complex scenarios**

A somewhat more abstract scenario would be the so called matter of scooping (al-ightiraaf). When performing wudu using a bucket with a small amount of water, after having washed one’s face (meaning when it’s the arms turn), dipping one’s hands into the bucket and taking them out right after would render the whole water ritually used. The reason for this is that the hadath of one’s hands was lifted when dipping them into the water and by taking them out the tahoor water detached from a wudu area which was ritually purified by it, which, as was mentioned previously, renders the water ritually used. To avoid this, one would have to intend ’scooping‘ when dipping one’s hands into the bucket.

Because this could be quite abstract and burdensome for the general public, even though we barely perform our wudu’s with buckets anymore, another strong opinion within our madhhab is usually mentioned, according to which the water would not become ritually used in this scenario. According to that opinion, one wouldn’t have to think about whether one was intending scooping or ritual purification and whether the water was rendered used or not by this scooping.

Another interesting issue would be, if one were to dip in a finger of one’s right arm into a bucket of water (after washing one’s face for wudu) then the water would technically still be tahoor and not ritually used but only in relation to one’s right arm (i.e. the object it has begun ritually purifying). This means that one could continue purifying the rest of one’s right arm but trying to wash one’s left arm as well, even if the water was still attached to the right arm and therefore still tahoor, would not be possible. Once the water detaches from the right arm as well, it would generally be deemed ritually used, even in relation the right arm.

Because the body is considered to be one area when it comes to ghusl, one could wash one’s left and right arm for ghusl like that though.

#### 4d. Only A Small Amount Of Water

Only a small amount of water can become ritually used. Therefore one wouldn’t have to worry about performing wudu in a lake and thereby ritually using up the water for everyone else. A large amount of water can therefore be used an infinite amount of times for ritual purificaiton.

If one were to gather small amounts of ritually used water up until they collectively amount to a large amount of water then one could use the water for ritual purification again as if it never was ritually used to begin with.

#### 4e. Estimation Of Changes That Are Not Observable

A mixture of ritually used water with tahoor water would end up looking like any other water. That’s why the things mentioned at section 3d would equally apply here.

#### 4f. Undoing Changes

Ritually used water can only become tahoor again by being a part of a large body of water, even if only for a moment. Even if this large body of water is the result of small amounts of ritually used water.

#### 4g. Matters Related To Certainty and Doubt

If one is not sure whether tahoor water has gotten ritually used then one assumes it to be still tahoor.

**Examples:**

- One is not sure whether the water in questions is a small or a large amount of water. Meaning, whether it can become ritually used or not to begin with.
- One is not sure whether the estimated scenario would lead to a strong change.

Nowadays, it’s not that relevant anyway because we usually don’t gather and reuse water that was used for wudu or ghusl. That’s why one wouldn’t have to pay too much attention to these things anyway.

If water has gotten ritually used and one is not sure whether it became a part of a large body of water then one would assume to still be ritually used.

(Just like with 3f) If one wanted to perform a recommended or obligatory wudu/ghusl and one had two buckets of water, one of which containing tahoor water but the other one containing used water, without knowing which bucket contains which water, then one would perform wudu/ghusl which each of them. #What about ritual impurities?

5. Najis, ritually impure

---

Water which was affected by a ritual impurity

#### 5a. Basics

One obviously would not be able to perform wudu with it. I just wanted to be explicit about it, even though that should be obvious.

Water becomes ritually impure due to the following reasons:

- A **small amount of non-flowing water** due to mere contact with a ritual impurity; whether or not this leads to a change in the water or not.
- A **large amount of (flowing or non-flowing) water** if it changes in any way due to a ritual impurity.
- A **small amount of flowing water** which flows over a ritually impure spot, if
  - the spot remains ritually impure,
  - the flowing water observably changes due to the ritual impurity
  - or the weight of the flowing water increases due to the ritual impurity.
- A ritual impurity falling into a **small amount of flowing water** (instead of the water flowing over it); whether or not the water changes due to that.

As was previously mentioned, _changes_ relate to the water’s odor, color or taste. Especially important in relation to ritually impure water: One is not required to actually check the taste. This would even be forbidden in relation to ritually impure water because that would unnecessarily make one affected by a ritual impurity. When our scholars talk about taste being a sign of change then this is primarily to be understood as a theoretical consideration and primarily intended to be estimated (without checking).

Changes in relation to a large body of water would only affect the changed part. Contary to a small amount of water, it wouldn’t automatically render the whole large body of water ritually impure.

In relation to the increase in the flowing water’s weight, this is also intended as more of an estimated consideration, whether or not the ritual impurity (even if it was removed) caused a significant increase in the flowing water’s weight. This is rarely the case anyway.

The differentiation between a small amount of water flowing over a ritual impurity instead of the ritual impurity falling into a small amount of flowing water goes back to how ritual impurities are removed. When the small amount of water comes to the ritually impurified object (e.g. flows to it) then it is capable of removing the ritual impurity. When it is the other way around (i.e. the ritually impurified object comes to the water) then there is no special consideration for the flowing water and it’s treated like the non-flowing (i.e. stagnant) water.

**Rather sophisticated topic:** Flowing water is technically not just treated as one single amount but rather subdivided into sections. Such a section encompasses the flowing water’s whole width but, length-wise, only the specific wave. So one would have to look at each wave individually to know whether that wave constitues a small or a large amount and then apply all the rulings to that specific wave which were previously mentioned.  
\[This is not that practial anyway but it is still mentioned in the books.\]

#### 5b. Excused scenarions in relation to a small amount of water

If creatures without flowing blood fall into a small amount of water and die therein then the small amount of water would not automatically become ritually impure. „Without flowing blood“ means that plucking such a creatures leg out would not lead to flowing blood coming from the wound. Examples would include ants, flies and beas.

If a certain amount of a ritual impurity falls into a small amount of water that the amount could not be seen by an average look under average conditions then this would also not render the small amount of water ritually impure. This is even the case when the ritual impurity is of the heavy type (i.e. from dogs and pigs).

What was mentioned relates to scenarios in which no change occurs in the water. And all of these things would only be excused if not intentionally caused like by throwing a fly into a small amount of water or intentionally spraying some barely perceptible ritual impurity on a small amount of water.

#### 5c. Estimation of changes that are not observable

If a large amount of tahoor water were to mix with a ritually impure liquid that has qualities just like water (meaning, a liquid that couldn’t be told apart from water) and could therefore never lead to any observable changes in the mixture then one would not be able to tell whether the water changed significantly or not. In this case one would do the following: One would assume this liquid to have heavy qualities and would judge the mixture based on that.

\[Keep in mind that changes are only required in relation to large amounts of water. So this discussion only relates to that.\]

An example for liquids with heavy qualities would be vinegar for the taste, musk for the odor and ink for the color.

This estimation is not obligatory but rather recommended. As long as one is not certain that the water would have changed based on such an estimation, one could just intentionally refrain from estimating it and still assume it to be pure. Estimating doesn’t mean that one would actually perform such an experiment with these substances. Just thinking it through would also count as a valid estimation.

#### 5d. Undoing changes

If the large amount of water no longer shows signs of the ritually impure changes (for example, due to it standing for a long time, being filtered or any other pure/impure water being added to it) then it is considered to be tahoor again.

If many small amounts of ritually impure water were added together until they reached one large amount then the water would also be tahoor again, provided there are no ritually impure changes in it.

Covering the changes up with the color, taste or smell of a pure substance would obviously not count as removing the signs of the ritually impure changes.

#### 5e. Matters related to certainty and doubt

If ritually pure water comes into contact with a ritual impurity, without this leading to a change, but one is not sure whether the water consitutes a small or a large amount then one assumes the water to remain ritually pure.

If one is not sure whether a small amount of water came into contact with a ritual impurity or not then one assumes that it didn’t.

If one is not sure whether ritually impure water became ritually pure again (for whatever reasons) then one assumes that it remained ritually impure. \[This ruling makes it a lot more difficult for the scenarion in which the ritually impure qualities of water were (intentionally or unintentionally) covered up by another pure substance.\]

If one is not sure whether a ritual impurity was big enough for it to be seen with an average look under average conditions then one assumes that it wouldn’t render water ritually impure.

If one is not sure whether a creature has flowing blood or not, fell into the water by itself or died then one assumes that it wouldn’t render water ritually impure.

If one wanted to perform a recommended or obligatory wudu/ghusl and one had two buckets of water, one of which containing tahoor water but the other one containing ritually impure water, without physical signs for it being ritually impure and without knowing which bucket contains which water, then one would investigate and choose the right bucket based on that. #What about ritual impurities?

Investigations in relation to these two doubtful buckets would still be permitted even if there was an additional third non-doubtful bucket with tahoor water. One wouldn’t be obliged to use the third bucket.

„Investigating“ means that one would review the situation and look for indicators, like for example waves in one of the buckets of water or an increased amount, if the reason for the ritual impurity is something haven fallen into the water. Merely following one’s gut would obviously not be sufficient.

If two muslims differ in their investigations then they may not pray together since they would consider the wudu of the other one to be invalid.

These investigations would also only be permitted if the bucket with the ritually impure liquid contained tahoor water (before it became ritually impure) instead of something like milk, tea or (an originally ritually impure liquid) urine. In this scenario investigations might not be permissible in relation to ritual purification but investigations would be permissible in this scenario to find out which of the two buckets may be used to drink from (for example a bucket with water and another one with milk, without knowing which one became ritually impure).

Performing wudu from one of the buckets without investigations but rather by blindly choosing one of them would be invalid even if one chose the right one.

If one can’t decide based on investigations then one wouldn’t use either of them and would just spill their contents and perform Tayammum due to the lack of water. If the amounts could be added together to a large amount of tahoor water then that would also be possible.
