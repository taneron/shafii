Bismillāhir-rahmānir-rahīm.  
Al-hamdu lillāhi rabbil-ālamīn.  
Was-salātu was-salāmu alā rasūlinā muhammad,  
wa alā ālihi wa sahbihi ajma’īn

In Deinem Namen lernen wir diese Dinge und nur Dir gegenüber müssen wir uns am Ende rechtfertigen.

**Shaykh Jamir:** „\[…\] Two: That it’s earth which is pure and purifying, has dust to it and is free from admixture.

It’s not a condition that one seeks out earth only. Any dust found on a rock, wall, floor, table or etc. suffices for tayammum as long as it fullfills the other conditions.

There are four conditions to the earth or dust and these are:  
1\. It must be pure. \[…\]  
2\. That it’s purifying \[…\]  
3\. It must be plain. Plain earth means that it has not been mixed with something else such as gypsum or flour.  
4\. It has dust to it. Earth with no dust such as moist earth, wood shavings (Hobelspäne), smooth rocks or sand with no earth to it don’t suffice.“  
**\[Mukhtasar as-Saghir, Tayammum – Condiitons, 1:50\]**

**Shaykh Jamir:**

„\[…\]  
There are four conditions to the earth and these are that:  
1\. It must be pure. \[…\]  
2\. That it’s purifying \[…\]  
3\. It must be plain. Pure earth that has been mixed with something else such as gypsum or flour can not be used.  
4\. It has dust to it. Earth with no dust such as moist earth, wood shavings (Hobelspäne), smooth rocks or sand with no dust to it don’t suffice.

We should also mention that if there was dust on a rock, wall, floor, table or etc. and one made tayammum, the tayammum would be valid as long as the dust is not mixed with anything else. It is also worth mentioning that in the hanafi school it is not a condition that the earth has dust on it but rather wiping the hands on anything that is from the earth such as a smooth stone or smooth sand suffices.“

**\[Matn Abu Shuja‘, Conditions of Tayammum, 14:50\]**

**SHK und F’I:**  
\# Alleiniger Sand wäre nicht ok.  
\# Sand vermischt mit Erde wäre aber ok.

**Ustadh Umar:**  
Staubiger Sand wäre ok.

**Ustadh Moustafa Elqabbany:**

„If there is relatively coarse (grob) sand and you hit your hands against it and your hands get dusty then that’s also acceptible. So soil would include sand that carries dust in it.“

**\[Safinat an-Naja, Tayammum, Vinegar, Hides, Types of Filth, 06:40\]**
