Appendix one  
The 6th time when prayer is forbidden

As we related above, from Sheikh Sulayman al-Bujayrmi, there is a 6th time when prayer is forbidden. One will find this issue discussed in the chapter dealing with the Friday Prayer and not the section dealing with times when the prayer is forbidden, except it in a few work such as al-Muqaddimat al-Hadhramiyyah by Sheikh BaFadhl.

Regarding the 6th time, Imam Ahmad al-Ramli says in Nihayat al-Muhtaj, it is \*prohibitively disliked, by scholarly consensus as mention by al-Mawardi and others, for any of the Friday Prayer attendees to offer supererogatory prayers \*after the orator has ascended to the Mimbar and is seated upon it, as mentioned in al-Majmu’.

\*Sheikh ‘Ali al-Shabramillisi comments upon Imam al-Ramli’s statement “prohibitively disliked” by saying, “and the disliked ness continues until the sermon and what follows it are complete.”

As for the time between the orator ascending and sitting, it is not forbidden to offer prayers at such time as Sheikh ‘Ali al-Shabramallisi notes.

Both the obligatory prayer, even a make-up, and optional prayers are unlawful and invalid at this time. When one is praying when the orator is ascending to the mimbar and seated upon it, it is obligatory to pray one’s prayer quickly as Imam al-Ramli relates from Sheikh Nasr. Moreover, Imam ibn Hajar mentions in Manhaj al-Qawim that it is unlawful to lengthen the prayer that one began before the orator ascended to the Mimbar. Thereafter, Imam ibn Hajar says that it is not permitted for the one entering to pray any prayer except two rak’ats of greeting the Masjid (ar: Tahiyyat al-Masjid). This is the exception to the praying being prohibitively disliked at the above time.

Similary, Imam al-Ramli mentions that the exception (to the above) is Tahiyyat al-Masjid for the one entering the Masjid while the orator is on the Mimbar. (In this case) it is Sunnah for him to perform Tahiyyat al-Masjid and it is obligatory for him to keep it short. What is meant by “keeping it short”, as Imam al-Ramli explains, is confining oneself to the integrals (of the prayer) and not praying fast as al-Zarkashi has mentioned. However, the sounder view (ar: al-Awjah) is that “keeping it short” means leaving what is customarily considered long. Sheikh ‘Ali al-Shabramillisi comments upon this last statement by saying, i.e. one may read a short Surah after Surat al-Fatihah.

The Jurists specifically mention two rak’ats, what if one performs more than that?

Imam al-Ramli says, “And one may not pray more than two rak’ats in any case.” Sheikh Sulayman al-Kurdi affirms this view by saying, and more than two rak’ats are invalid.

Another problem comes up; what if one enters the Masjid and the orator isn’t delivering the Friday Sermon?

Imam al-Ramli says, “if one deems it most likely that by praying Tahiyyat al-Masjid one will miss the opening Takbir with the Imam, then one does not pray it (al-Shabramillisi adds, as a recommendation, i.e. not a prohibition. However, Imam Ibn Hajar clearly states that it is disliked in Manhaj al-Qawim), rather one stands until the prayer commences. One does not sit (in such a scenario) so to avoid sitting before praying Tahiyyat al-Masjid. Furthermore, Ibn al-Rif’ah says that if one prayed in this case (mentioned by Imam al-Ramli) then it is recommended for the Imam to lengthen the Friday Sermon’s speech to the extent that (the one praying Tahiyyat al-Masjid) can complete it. Sheikh al-Islam said, and that which he mentioned (i.e. Ibn al-Rif’ah) has been laid down in al-Umm. Nihayat al-Muhtaj

And Allah Ta ‘Ala knows best.
